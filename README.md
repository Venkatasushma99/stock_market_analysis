This repository contains scripts and resources for performing stock market analysis using various technologies including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for data analysis, scripting, and integration with AWS services.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud platform used for storing data, data processing, and analytics.
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform used for real-time data processing.
- **AWS Glue**: Fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service for data integration.
- **Amazon Athena**: Interactive query service used to analyze data stored in AWS S3 using standard SQL.

## Implementation
** Step 1:** Set up the EC2 instance in AWS and configure it on to your local machine
** Step 2:** Install Java (any latest Version in the cmd)
** Step 3:** Load and extract the kafka tar file
** Step 4:** Start Zookeeper and Kafka Server in two sepearte terminals
** Step 5:** Create a topic for the producers to write and consumers to read
** Step 6:** Start the Producers and Consumers console in two different terminals
** Step 7:** Create AWS S3 bucket and configure it on consumer console
** Step 8:** Read the data from local machine and generate sample data from producers
** Step 9:** Once the data generates by producers then files can be seen on S3
** Step 10:** For Further analysis connect the AWS Glue and Crawler for data integration
** Step 11:** Use AWS Athena for the data Analysis
